  title = {{To Make a Robot Secure: An Experimental Analysis of Cyber Security
	Threats Against Teleoperated Surgical Robotics}},
  journal = {arXiv preprint},
  year = {2015},
  pages = {1--11},
  month = {apr},
  abstract = {Teleoperated robots are playing an increasingly important role in
	military actions and medical services. In the future, remotely operated
	surgical robots will likely be used in more scenarios such as battlefields
	and emergency response. But rapidly growing applications of teleoperated
	surgery raise the question; what if the computer systems for these
	robots are attacked, taken over and even turned into weapons? Our
	work seeks to answer this question by systematically analyzing possible
	cyber security attacks against Raven II, an advanced teleoperated
	robotic surgery system. We identify a slew of possible cyber security
	threats, and experimentally evaluate their scopes and impacts. We
	demonstrate the ability to maliciously control a wide range of robots
	functions, and even to completely ignore or override command inputs
	from the surgeon. We further find that it is possible to abuse the
	robot's existing emergency stop (E-stop) mechanism to execute efficient
	(single packet) attacks. We then consider steps to mitigate these
	identified attacks, and experimentally evaluate the feasibility of
	applying the existing security solutions against these threats. The
	broader goal of our paper, however, is to raise awareness and increase
	understanding of these emerging threats. We anticipate that the majority
	of attacks against telerobotic surgery will also be relevant to other
	teleoperated robotic and co-robotic systems.},

  title = {{Robotics and the New Cyberlaw}},
  journal = {SSRN Electronic Journal},
  year = {2014},
  pages = {101--146},
  abstract = {Two decades of analysis have produced a rich set of insights as to
	how the law should apply to the Internet’s peculiar characteristics.
	But, in the meantime, technology has not stood still. The same public
	and private institutions that developed the Internet, from the armed
	forces to search engines, have initiated a significant shift toward
	robotics and artificial intelligence. This article is the first to
	examine what the introduction of a new, equally transformative technology
	means for cyberlaw (and law in general). Robotics has a different
	set of essential qualities than the Internet and, accordingly, will
	raise distinct issues of law and policy. Robotics combines, for the
	first time, the promiscuity of data with the capacity to do physical
	harm; robotic systems accomplish tasks in ways that cannot be anticipated
	in advance; and robots increasingly blur the line between person
	and instrument.Cyberlaw can and should evolve to meet these challenges.
	Cyberlaw is interested, for instance, in how people are hardwired
	to think of going online as entering a “place,” and in the ways software
	constrains human behavior. The new cyberlaw will consider how we
	are hardwired to think of anthropomorphic machines as though they
	were social, and ponder the ways institutions and jurists can manage
	the behavior of software. Ultimately the methods and norms of cyberlaw
	— particularly its commitments to interdisciplinary pragmatism —
	will prove crucial in integrating robotics, and perhaps whatever
	technology follows.},

  abstract = {New safety critical systems are about to appear in our everyday life:
	advanced robots able to interact with humans and perform tasks at
	home, in hospitals, or at work. A hazardous behavior of those systems,
	induced by failures or extreme environment conditions, may lead to
	catastrophic consequences. Well-known risk analysis methods used
	in other critical domains (e.g., avionics, nuclear, medical, transportation),
	have to be extended or adapted due to the non-deterministic behavior
	of those systems, evolving in unstructured environments. One major
	challenge is thus to develop methods that can be applied at the very
	beginning of the development process, to identify hazards induced
	by robot tasks and their interactions with humans. In this paper
	we present a method which is based on an adaptation of a hazard identification
	technique, HAZOP (Hazard Operability), coupled with a system description
	notation, UML (Unified Modeling Language). This systematic approach
	has been applied successfully in research projects, and is now applied
	by robot manufacturers. Some results of those studies are presented
	and discussed to explain the benefits and limits of our method.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the last few years, the Robot Operating System
	(ROS) has become a highly popular software framework for robotics
	research. ROS has a very active developer community and is widely
	used for robotics research in both academia and government labs.
	The prevalence and modularity of ROS cause many people to ask the
	question: "What prevents ROS from being used in commercial or government
	applications?" One of the main problems that is preventing this increased
	use of ROS in these applications is the question of characterizing
	its security (or lack thereof). In the summer of 2012, a crowd sourced
	cyber-physical security contest was launched at the cyber security
	conference DEF CON 20 to begin the process of characterizing the
	security of ROS. A small-scale, car-like robot was configured as
	a cyber-physical security "honeypot" running ROS. DEFFCON-20 attendees
	were invited to find exploits and vulnerabilities in the robot while
	network traffic was collected. The results of this experiment provided
	some interesting insights and opened up many security questions pertaining
	to deployed robotic systems. The Federal Aviation Administration
	is tasked with opening up the civil airspace to commercial drones
	by September 2015 and driverless cars are already legal for research
	purposes in a number of states. Given the integration of these robotic
	devices into our daily lives, the authors pose the following question:
	"What security exploits can a motivated person with little-to-no
	experience in cyber security execute, given the wide availability
	of free cyber security penetration testing tools such as Metasploit?"
	This research focuses on applying common, low-cost, low-overhead,
	cyber-attacks on a robot featuring ROS. This work documents the effectiveness
	of those attacks. © 2013 SPIE.},

  number = {9},
  abstract = {Domestic robotics is a growing sector with the potential for a large
	number of commercial applications. Robotics technologies have been
	successfully applied in industrial production lines, yet, for them
	to be successful in a dynamic household environment the need for
	increased reliability, robustness and other special capabilities
	become paramount. We are not far from the time when people will live
	and interact with robots and, thus, safety becoming the fundamental
	issue to observe. Robot designers should produce safe products for
	humans no matter what failure, malfunction or mishandle may occur.
	Thus, respective safety procedures ought to be applied to domestic
	robots as well. The most critical challenge is to preserve safety
	of humans without forfeiting a single token of the efficiency required
	to perform any task. In this technical communication, the authors
	address the need for safety regulations in domestic robotics and,
	while they do not intend to replace any current robot safety standards
	or guidelines, the proposed work may serve as a supplement to the
	standards. Since specific safety standards for domestic robots are
	not available, we propose that their safety verification should be
	carried out on the base of well-applied standards that developed
	in other areas and discussed here. The communication in hand provides
	the ground upon which a standard on domestic robots can be built.
	Moreover, it proposes a systemic approach that explicitly relates
	the system and user requirements to a list of safety problems, in
	order to achieve an adequate level of safety in domestic robotics.

  abstract = {With the expected introduction of robots into our daily lives, providing

	in a “happy naivety,” where security rules against external attacks
	are not adopted, assuming that robotics knowledgeable people are
	well intended. While this may have been true in the past, the mass
	adoption of robots will increase the possibilities of attacks. This
	fact is especially relevant in defense, medical and other critical
